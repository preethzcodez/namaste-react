# NAMASTE REACT - ASSIGNMENT 02 - IGNITING OUR APP

## CODING
- intialize `npm` into your repo
- install `react` and `react-dom`
- remove CDN links of react
- install parcel
- ignite your app with parcel
- add scripts for “start” and “build” with parcel commands
- add `.gitignore` file
- add `browserlists`
- build a production version of your code using `parcel build`

## THEORY

### 01. What is NPM?
NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. NPM is used to install, share, and distribute packages (which are collections of code that are designed to be reusable) and to manage dependencies (libraries and packages that are required by your code). NPM is a command-line interface that is installed with Node.js, and it is used to download packages from the npm registry, which is a public repository of packages of open-source code. With NPM, developers can publish their own packages and use packages created by other developers. NPM helps to reduce the time and effort required to build and maintain large JavaScript applications by making it easy to reuse code and manage dependencies.

### 02. What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
Parcel and Webpack are both module bundlers for JavaScript. A module bundler is a tool that takes the many small files that make up a large JavaScript application and combines them into a single file (or a few files) that can be loaded by the browser.

There are several reasons why developers use module bundlers:

- **Modularity:** JavaScript applications are often made up of many small files, each containing a specific piece of functionality. By using a module bundler, developers can organize their code into small, reusable modules that can be imported and exported as needed. This makes it easier to develop and maintain large applications.

- **Code optimization:** Module bundlers can perform various types of code optimization, such as minification (removing unnecessary characters from the code), tree shaking (removing unused code), and dead code elimination (removing code that is never executed). This can help to reduce the size of the final bundled code and improve the performance of the application.

- **Compatibility:** Some JavaScript features are not supported by all browsers. A module bundler can transform the code to make it compatible with a wider range of browsers, allowing developers to use newer features without worrying about browser compatibility issues.

- **Easy to use:** Module bundlers provide a simple interface for building and deploying JavaScript applications, making it easy for developers to set up and maintain their projects.

Parcel and Webpack are two of the most popular module bundlers. Both have their own strengths and are suitable for different types of projects. Developers can choose the one that best fits their needs.
